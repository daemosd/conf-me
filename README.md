# conf-me
Centralized location of configuration files for tools/programs that I use on a regular basis. I created this to easily help get my favorite tools up and running with a configuration that helps me get my daily tasks accomplished and the streamline any account setups I have for a new OS that I need to work/play around with (whether in my personal VM lab or for working purposes).

I'll add new updates to this repo whenever I find/discover new configuration settings that can further optimize my processes. I welcome any input in regards to make these tools the absolute best they can be!

### Specific Notes
#### tmux
For the tmux configuration file, you need to be running tmux version >=2.0 in order to not run into any configuration line errors at tmux execution time. If you run into any errors launching your tmux, check your version number first with command 

`tmux -V` 

before troubleshooting any further. 

#### Vim
I'm not aware of any vimrc options conflicting with older version of Vim, but for the sake of balance I'll state that my vim options were tested using version >=7.4.
