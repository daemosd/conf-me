# conf-me
Centralized location of configuration files for tools/programs that I use on a regular basis. I created this to easily help get my favorite tools up and running with a configuration that helps me get my daily tasks accomplished and the streamline any account setups I have for a new OS that I need to work/play around with (whether in my personal VM lab or for working purposes).
