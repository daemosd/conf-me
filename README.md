# conf-me
Centralized location of configuration files for tools/programs that I use on a regular basis. I created this to easily help get my favorite tools up and running with a configuration that helps me get my daily tasks accomplished and the streamline any account setups I have for a new OS that I need to work/play around with (whether in my personal VM lab or for working purposes).

I'll add new updates to this repo whenever I find/discover new configuration settings that can further optimize my processes. I welcome any input in regards to make these tools the absolute best they can be!

### Usage
These config files are released for the public domain and you are free to download, make modifications, and otherwise use these config files as you see fit for your development environment without needing to attribute credit to myself.
